## What is Python?
Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without prepared code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line.

There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features.

To print a string in Python 3, just write:
print("This line will be printed.");

### Indentation
Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces
```js
if name == 'Akshay':
        print(name);
```
